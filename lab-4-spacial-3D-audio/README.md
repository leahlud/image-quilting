# lab-4: 3D Audio

In this lab we will learn how to create 3D sounds for headphone playback. We will make use of simple filters and HRTFs to create static and moving sources. Use the three sounds fly.wav, helicopter.wav, and crumble.wav in the lab archive as sources for the 3D recording that you will create.
